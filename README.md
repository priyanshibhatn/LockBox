Data Encryption is the process of protecting and securing data by encoding it in such a way that it can only be accessed or decrypted by someone who has the encryption key. In Data encryption, the data is scrambled before it is sent to the person who can unscramble it using a key.

The two types of data encryption methods are Symmetric Encryption and Asymmetric Encryption. Symmetric encryption is also known as private-key cryptography or secret key algorithm and requires both the parties of sender and receiver to have access to the same key to decrypt the data. Asymmetric Encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses two separate keys for encryption process. One key is a public key and the other is a private key which are linked and used for encryption and decryption.

Encryption is used to protect data being transmitted. This ensures data doesnâ€™t fall into the wrong hands of cybercriminals, hackers, internet service providers, spammers, and even government institutions. Any time you access ATM or sending messages across devices such as Snapchat, these messages are encrypted to ensure that no-one other than the person it was sent to can access it.

WEP and WPA are encryption technologies that are extensively used in wireless routers. Examples of asymmetric encryption include RSA and DSA. RC4 and DES are two instances of symmetric encryption. In addition to encryption techniques, there are what is known as Common Criteria (CC).

Simply put, encryption is the act of encoding data so that it is concealed from or unavailable to unauthorized users. It aids in the protection of private information and sensitive data, as well as the security of communication between client apps and servers.

DES, AES, and RSA are the three primary encryption types. A more recent 3DES is a block cipher that is still in use today. The Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) does exactly what its name says. For triple protection, it employs three independent 56-bit keys rather than a single 56-bit key. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used for confidential communications by governments, security groups, and common enterprises. "Rivest-Shamir-Adleman," or RSA, is another common encryption system. It is frequently used to encrypt data transferred over the internet and depends on a public key to do so. Those receiving the data will be given their own private key to decode the communications.
